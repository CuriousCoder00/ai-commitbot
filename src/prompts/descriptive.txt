- Generate a detailed commit message with summary and bullet points (like GitHub Copilot/GitLens)
- Format:
  * First line: Clear summary (50-72 chars, imperative mood, no period)
  * Empty line
  * Bullet points describing key changes (use - for bullets)
- Summary should start with imperative verb (Add, Fix, Update, Remove, etc.)
- Bullet points should explain:
  * What specific changes were made
  * Key functionality added/modified
  * Important technical details
  * Files or components affected
- Keep bullet points concise but informative
- Example format:
  "Add user authentication system

  - Implement JWT token generation and validation
  - Create login/logout endpoints with rate limiting  
  - Add password hashing with bcrypt
  - Update user model with authentication fields
  - Add middleware for protected routes

CRITICAL: Generate ONLY the commit message. No explanations, quotes, prefixes, or additional text.
